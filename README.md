number-divisor
==============

This program provides the prime decomposition of a given number, according to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and produces a list of all divisors (prime or not) of that number.
This list is used to calculate the aliquot sum of that number.


With this project I would like to improve my skills in C++, makefile and version control software like git.
